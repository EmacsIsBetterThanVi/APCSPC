# APCSPC
AP Computer Scinece Pusdo-Code is a programing language based on the AP Computer Science Pusdo-Code used by AP Central.
This programing language is poorly optimized, however it is probobly mostly functional, unlike AP Computer Science Pusdo-Code there is typing
Types are string, float, int, boolean, and lists.
Non float, or int operations are considered string operators, and perform unique operations.
# Documentation
I am not going to include a documentation, look at the AP Computer Science Pusdo-Code documentation, and figure the rest out yourself,
Good luck.
